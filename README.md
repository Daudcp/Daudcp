# 👋 Hey there, I’m Daud Cheema Parveen

I’m a Cyber Security student at Manchester Metropolitan University with a strong interest in ethical hacking, digital forensics, and network defence. I’m passionate about understanding how systems work, how they can be exploited, and how to protect them effectively.  

This GitHub page is where I’ll be building and sharing my journey as I learn more about security concepts, coding, and practical problem-solving. My goal is to develop real technical skills through hands-on learning and create projects that reflect my progress over time.  

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to connect or follow my journey as I continue learning and growing in the field of cyber security.
