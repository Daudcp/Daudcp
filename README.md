# 👋 Hey there, I’m Daud Cheema Parveen

I’m a Cyber Security student at Manchester Metropolitan University with a growing interest in ethical hacking, network defence, and digital forensics. I enjoy learning how systems can be attacked and, more importantly, how to protect them.  

This space is where I document my learning journey, build projects, and share hands-on work that strengthens my technical and problem-solving skills.
